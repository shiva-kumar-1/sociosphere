# SocioSphere

---

## Project Overview
SocioSphere is a web application project with separate frontend and backend modules, managed in a single GitHub repository. The project follows best practices with branch protection and controlled collaboration to maintain code quality and structured development.

## Repository Structure
- `Frontend/` - Contains all frontend source code (React, HTML, CSS, JS, etc.)  
- `Backend/` - Contains all backend source code (APIs, database models, server logic)

## Branching Workflow
- The repository uses two main feature branches for active development:
  - `feature/frontend` - For all frontend work
  - `feature/backend` - For all backend work
- Contributors with write access push only to these branches.
- New branches are not allowed; all changes go through pull requests to these feature branches.
- The main branch (`main`) is protected and only updated via reviewed pull requests.

## Collaboration Guidelines
- Write role users cannot create new branches but can push to the designated feature branches.
- Pull requests must be reviewed and approved by maintainers before merging.
- Code reviews ensure adherence to project standards and prevent conflicts.
